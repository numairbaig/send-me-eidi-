            <h1>Why you must send Eidi? ü§î</h1><br>
            <h2>Eidi Tradition</h2>
            <p>Eidi, also known as Eidya, is a cherished Middle Eastern Arab tradition associated with the celebration
                of two significant Muslim holidays: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Here are some key points about Eidi:
            </p>

            <h2>Purpose and Tradition:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Eidi involves gifting cash to children and family members.</li>
                <li>Older relatives or family friends typically give Eidi.</li>
                <li>The act of giving Eidi has historical ties to Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).</li>
                <li>It emphasizes celebrating and rewarding children, allowing them independence and choice in selecting
                    their gifts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Customs and Practices:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Children line up from youngest to oldest in front of the oldest family member to receive their Eidi.
                </li>
                <li>The value of the gift increases with the age of the child.</li>
                <li>The last child in the line often receives the highest value gift.</li>
                <li>Spouses may give jewelry, clothes, watches, perfume, or makeup.</li>
                <li>Parents and in-laws may give adult children clothes or cosmetics.</li>
                <li>Friends and siblings often exchange Eidi cards.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While the practice of giving Eidi is not universal, it remains prominent in many Muslim cultures
                globally. It symbolizes generosity, joy, and the spirit of sharing during these festive occasions. üåôüéÅ
